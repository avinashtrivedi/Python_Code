"""Unit test support functions

This module provides function-level unit testing tools.  It is a 
replacement for the built-in Python package unittest, which is much
less user friendly and requires an understanding of OO programming.
The assert functions in this library are intended to integrate
with stack-trace infor when errors occur."""
