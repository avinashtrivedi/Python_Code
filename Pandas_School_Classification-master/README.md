# Pandas_Homework_Schools
This was an exercise using Pandas to show results by school type (charter vs. public) by looking at test grades and funding.

Directions:
District Summary
Calculate the total number of schools

Calculate the total number of students
Calculate the total budget
Calculate the average math score
Calculate the average reading score
Calculate the overall passing rate (overall average score), i.e. (avg. math score + avg. reading score)/2
Calculate the percentage of students with a passing math score (70 or greater)
Calculate the percentage of students with a passing reading score (70 or greater)
Create a dataframe to hold the above results
Optional: give the displayed data cleaner formatting

Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
Sort and display the top five schools in overall passing rate

Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
Sort and display the five worst-performing schools

Math Scores by Grade
Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Create a pandas series for each grade. Hint: use a conditional statement.
Group each series by school
Combine the series into a dataframe
Optional: give the displayed data cleaner formatting

Reading Score by Grade
Perform the same operations as above for reading scores

Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

Scores by School Size
Perform the same operations as above, based on school size.
