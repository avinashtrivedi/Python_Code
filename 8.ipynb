Use the round function (look it up on google or on python docs) to round your sum to 4 decimal points.Show how might you check your answer.[Hints: initialize a sum accumulator. Set up a for loop with a range statement. How many times should you go through the loop? What should the range be? Inside the loop, compute the current fraction and add it to the sum accumulator. You will need a mechanism to alternate the signs of the fractions being added. One way to make the sign alternate is to use (-1)**n, where n is an int – the sign of this expression alternates as n changes from even to odd – check it out! </h3>"
