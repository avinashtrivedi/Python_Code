The judgment of the Court was  deliv-\\nered by\\n     MAHAJAN  J .--This is an appeal from the  judgment\\t and\\ndecree of the High Court of Bombay dated 9th March 1943\\t and\\nmade in Second Appeal No. 717 of 1940 varying the decree  of\\nthe  Assistant\\nJudge, Ahmedabad, in Appeal No. 173  of\\t1936\\nreversing  the decree of the Joint Sub-Judge, Ahmedabad,  in\\nSuit No. 830 of 1933.<p>\\n     The  suit out of which this appeal arises was filed  by\\nthe  respondent firm in ejectment to recover  possession  of\\nsurvey\\nNos.  222, 223, 225 and 226 situate  in\\t Rampura  in\\nAhmedabad district and for mesne profits, as early as  July,\\n1933,  and during\\nits 17 years\\' span of life it had a  some-\\nwhat chequered career.\\tThose responsible for drawing up the\\npleadings  did not take pains\\nto comprehend correctly as  to\\nwhat they were about and the whole litigation was  conducted\\nin  a  slovenly\\t and  slipshod\\t manner.\\n   Evidence   which\\nshould have been produced at the beginning was allowed to be\\nproduced  at a much later stage after the case went\\nback  on\\nremand and the suit was determined by the Assistant Judge on\\nfresh  issues and fresh materials. It was in  this  confused\\nstate  of the record that it was eventually decided  by\\t the\\nHigh  Court  and its judgment is by no\\tmeans  satisfactory,\\nThe  long\\n time taken in deciding the  suit  which  involved\\ndetermination of a few simple issues is such as is calculat-\\ned to bring into\\nridicule the administration of justice.<p>\\n77\\n    There  is a talukdari estate called the Bhankoda  estate\\nin  Viramgam  taluka in Ahmedabad district.  It\\t is  jointly\\nowned\\nby several talukdars in different shares and comprises\\ntwelve\\tvillages one of which is Rampura in which  the\\tsuit\\nlands are situate.\\n By Government Resolution No. 8170, dated\\n30th   August  1912, the estate was taken  under  Government\\nmanagement  under  section\\n28 of the Gujarat  Talukdars\\t Act\\n(Bombay Act VI of 1888).  The firm of Shah Manilal  Maganlal\\nand  Bros. (predecessors in interest\\nof the  appellant)\\t de-\\nsired  to erect a ginning factory on survey Nos.  228,\\t225,\\nand  226 and with that object approached the\\nTalukdari\\tSet-\\ntlement\\t Officer for a permanent lease of these survey\\tnum-\\nbers.  The said officer agreed to grant a lease\\t subject\\n to\\nsanction  of  Government.  By Resolution No. 10795  of\\t1917\\ndated  5th September 1917 the Government of  Bombay  granted\\nthe\\n requisite sanction. Exhibit 181 is a certified copy  of\\nthe  letter  from the Chief Secretary to Government  to\\t the\\nCommissioner\\nand to the Talukdari Settlement Officer and  in\\ndetail\\tit  mentions the various steps taken to\\t effect\\t the\\ntransaction.<p>\\n    On\\t9th  December 1916 an application was made  by\\tShah\\nManilal\\t Maganlal in writing signed by him to the  Talukdari\\nSettlement\\nOfficer offering to take a permanent lease of the\\nabove  mentioned survey numbers on an annual rental  of\\t Rs.<p>\\n290 for the purpose of erecting a ginning factory.  On\\t12th\\nJuly 1917 the said officer accepted provisionally this offer\\nafter  taking\\n into consideration the objections  raised  by\\nsome  of the talukdars in respect of the grant of  a  lease.<p>\\nHe  submitted  the papers to government with  the  following\\nrecommendations :--\\n    \"As\\t the petitioner was in urgent need to  start\\n opera-\\ntions during the current ginning season I have in  anticipa-\\ntion of Government sanction permitted him to enter upon\\t the\\nland and have the honour to approach you for sanction  under\\nsection 27 (A) of the Court of Wards Act, the provisions  of\\nwhich \\nhave  been made applicable to  Talukdari\\t Estates  by\\nsection 29 (G) of the Gujarat Talukdars Act,\"\\n78\\n    The\\t conditions of the\\nlease agreed upon by the  parties\\nwere  annexed with this letter and a copy of the  offer\\t was\\nalso sent to Government. Ex. 181 recites\\nthe contents of the\\noffer and states the undertaking given by the lessee.  There\\nis intrinsic evidence within its contents to show\\nthat these\\nwritings were signed by the proposer. The Talukdari  Settle-\\nment Officer in a signed writing accepted the offer and sent\\nit  for\\t Government  sanction. It further  appears  that  he\\ncommunicated his acceptance to the lessee and agreed to give\\na lease\\nif Government gave sanction.  The survey numbers  in\\nquestion  were\\tin possession of tenants and it\\t was  agreed\\nthat  the lessee\\nwould take possession after making  private\\nsettlements  with them.\\t It was also agreed that if no\\tsuch\\nprivate\\t arrangement  could\\n be made,  then  the  settlement\\nofficer\\t would take steps to issue ejectment notice  against\\nthe tenants.  On 20th July, 1917, the\\nCommissioner forwarded\\nthe  papers to Government with his recommendations  and\\t the\\nGovernment  on 5th September, 1917, sanctioned\\nthe  arrange-\\nment agreed to by the Talukdari Settlement Officer with Shah\\nManilal Maganlal.  The sanction order is signed by the\\nChief\\nSecretary  to the Government and it contains an\\t endorsement\\nof  its having been sent to the officers concerned.   It  is\\nthus\\n clear  that a binding agreement to  lease\\t the  survey\\nnumbers\\t in  question  was effected  between  the  Talukdari\\nSettlement Officer\\nand Shah Manilal Maganlal with the  sanc-\\ntion  of the Government. Though a draft of a formal deed  of\\nlease  was prepared, no such\\ndocument was formally  executed\\nor registered for reasons which it is not necessary to state\\nherein.<p>\\n    Soon  after the agreement the lessee took possession  of\\nthe  survey numbers in suit and put up thereupon  a  ginning\\nand  a\\npressing factory, a bungalow, engine rooms and  other\\nstructures.   He tendered the agreed rent to  the  Talukdari\\nSettlement  Officer\\nwho received it from him.  He  continued\\nreceiving  it  for about two years when the estate  was\\t re-\\nleased from the management\\nof the Government and came  under\\nthe  management of the talukdars. The manager  appointed  by\\nthe  talukdars continued to receive\\nrent from the lessee  as\\nhad been settled by the Talukdari Settlement Officer.<p>\\n79\\n    On\\t4th May, 1924, a possessory mortgage of the  ginning\\nfactory\\t along with all its buildings was effected  by\\tShah\\nManilal\\nMaganlal in the sum of Rs. 1,40,000 in favour of the\\ndefendant.   The  mortgage included in the schedule  of\\t the\\nmortgaged  property\\nsome other property as \\'well.   The\\t two\\ncontestants  in the suit, the defendant and the\\t plaintiffs,\\nacquired  their\\t rights in\\nthis property  during  the  years\\n1924-25.   The\\tdefend ant came in as a mortgagee  as  above\\nstated, while the plaintiffs came in\\nas ijaradar and assign-\\nee  of certain mortgage rights.\\t The plaintiffs\\t since\\tthen\\nhave been receiving the rent according to the\\ngrant made  by\\nthe  Talukdari\\tOfficer.   In the year\\t1933  the  appellant\\npurchased the equity of redemption of the suit property\\nat a\\ncourt auction and became vested with all the rights of Mani-\\nlal  Maganlal in this property, the value of which  has\\t now\\nbeen\\nestimated in the neighbourhood of Rs. 38,000.<p>\\n    In\\tthe  year 1933\\tthe plaintiffs discovered  that\\t the\\ndefendant   had\\t no  registered\\t lease\\tin  his\\t favour\\t and\\ntherefore\\n in  law he  was not entitled to the rights  of  a\\npermanent  tenant  in respect of the   survey\\tnumbers\\t  in\\ndispute.  They\\ttherefore\\ninstituted the present  suit\\t for\\nejectment  of the defendant.  In the 2nd and 3rd  paragraphs\\nof  the plaint it was  admitted that\\nin .the course  of\\t the\\ncorrespondence\\twith  the Government of Bombay a  lease\\t was\\nnegotiated   between the firm of Shah Manilal\\n Maganlal\\t and\\nthe  Talukari  Settlement Officer in respect of\\t the  survey\\nnumbers in dispute for a period of fifty years at an\\n annual\\nrental\\tof Rs. 290, but it was stated that  because  Manilal\\nMaganlal did not execute a formal registered lease they were\\nin  possession\\tas  trespassers. In the\\t 4th  paragraph\\t the\\nauthority  of the Talukdari Settlement Officer to grant\\t the\\nlease was\\nalso challenged.  In the 8th paragraph it was said\\nthat  the plaintiffs received the amount of the lease up  to\\n31st July 1932 and\\nthat no notice was necessary to be given,\\nthe position of the defendant being that of a trespasser. It\\nwas however alleged that a\\nnotice was given on 25th December\\n1930,\\n11\\n80\\n    The suit was defended on a number of grounds,inter alia,\\nit  was pleaded that the\\nplaintiffs had no right to  sue  in\\nejectment,  not being the landlord inasmuch as they had\\t not\\nobtained  any right in the land\\nitself and had not  acquired\\ncomplete title by an assignment of the whole of the interest\\nof  the talukdars in the survey numbers\\nin dispute.  It\\t was\\npleaded\\t that  the defendant was a permanent tenant  of\\t the\\nsurvey numbers and that the plaintiffs\\' own conduct\\ndebarred\\nthem from claiming ejectment.<p>\\n   The\\ttrial Judge decreed the suit on the finding that  as\\nno  written lease was forthcoming it should be deemed to  be\\nnon-existent.\\n It was said that no efforts had been made  to\\nshow  that  the Settlement Officer had sanctioned  with\\t the\\napproval  of the Government\\na permanent lease in respect  of\\nsurvey\\tNos. 223 and 225 to Shah Manilal Maganlal.   In\\t the\\nconcluding  part  of the judgment it\\nwas remarked  that\\t the\\ndoctrine  of equitable part performance could not  apply  to\\nthe  present  case. Though no specific issue\\nwas  raised  on\\nthis  point,  the matter seems to have been argued  at\\tsome\\nstage  before  the trial Judge on facts found  or  admitted.<p>\\nThere was an unsuccessful effort to obtain a review of this\\ndecision  on  the  ground  of  discovery  of  fresh  materi-\\nals.  Thereafter\\nthe matter was taken to the court of appeal\\nand  it\\t was alleged in ground No. 3  that  the\\t Subordinate\\nJudge  had erred in not\\nconsidering the position created  in\\nthe  case by the equitable rule of law embodied\\t in  section\\n53-A  of the Transfer of Property\\nAct.\\tOn 30th July,  1938,\\nthe appellate court made an order of remand under Order XLI,\\nRule  25,  and\\tcalled for a report  on\\t the\\n following\\t two\\nissues:-\\n   (1) Whether the plaintiff was a mortgagee in occupa-\\ntion of S. Nos. 222, 223, 225 and 226 ?\\n   (2) Whether\\nthe suit was bad for non-joinder of\\nparties ?\\n    The\\t trial Judge reported on the remand  issues  against\\nthe  plaintiffs.  He also\\nadmitted in evidence a  number  of\\ndocuments produced after remand and one of these is Ex. 181.<p>\\nA point was raised that documents produced after remand Were\\nnot relevant to the issues remanded\\n81\\nand should not be admitted. \\nThis contention was  overruled.<p>\\nThe Assistant Judge allowed the appeal on 27th April,  1940.<p>\\nHe  held that the plaintiffs had failed to  establish  their\\nright to maintain the suit either as ijaradars or as assign-\\nees  of\\nmortgage  rights.   In para. 21 of his\\tjudgment  he\\nobserved as follows :--\\n    \"Ex.  181  shows that the terms of the lease  have\\nbeen\\nreduced to writing though  no regular  lease appears to have\\nbeen executed.\\tOn the question whether the lease is binding\\non\\n the plaintiff, I think section 53-A of the\\tTransfer  of\\nthe  Property Act is a complete answer.\\t Ex. 181 shows\\tthat\\nthe  Talukdari\\nSettlement Officer, with the sanction of\\t the\\nGovernment, contracted to lease out these lands.  The  writ-\\ning is signed by the Government.\\n The terms of the lease can\\nbe ascertained clearly from Ex. 181.  It is not denied\\tthat\\nthe  defendant\\'s predecessor-in-title was\\nput in  possession\\nof this property in performance of that contract.  Also\\t the\\nacceptance by the Talukdari Settlement Officer as\\n  well  as\\nby  the plaintiff of the rent of the property as   fixed  by\\nthat  contract shows that. the possession of  the  defendant\\nand his predecessor-in-title was in part performance of\\t the\\ncontract  of   lease.  Admittedly, there  is  no  registered\\nlease.\\n The conditions of section 53-A of the\\tTransfer  of\\nProperty  Act are fully satisfied and the plaintiff  cannot,\\ntherefore,  eject\\nthe defendant on the ground that there  is\\nno registered lease.\"\\n    Further  on the learned Judge said that section 53-A  of\\nthe\\n \\'Transfer\\tof  Property Act embodied  the\\tdoctrine  of\\nestoppel  and a plea to that effect had been taken  inasmuch\\nas  the\\t defendant\\n had pleaded\\t that  the  plaintiffs\\twere\\nestopped  by  their conduct from asking for  possession\\t and\\nthat therefore no separate\\nissue was raised on this point.<p>\\n    The\\t unsuccessful  plaintiffs went up in  second  appeal\\nagainst this decision to the High. Court of Bombay. The High\\nCourt \\nallowed\\tthe appeal and modified the  decree  of\\t the\\nAssistant Judge.  It decreed the plaintiffs\\' suit in respect\\nof survey Nos.\\n223 and 225 and dismissed the suit in respect\\nof survey Nos. 222 and 226,\\n82\\nOn  the\\t question of the plaintiffs\\' title to  maintain\\n the\\nsuit the High Court reached the following decision:-\\n    \"If\\t it were necessary we would hold that the  plaintiff\\nhas sufficiently\\nproved that it is entitled to maintain this\\nsuit  in its capacity as ijaradar as well as  assignee\\tfrom\\nthe mortgagees. But we think\\neven apart from that, plaintiff\\nis  entitled to bring this suit because on  the\\t defendant\\'s\\nown admission he has paid rent to the\\nplaintiff for three of\\nthe  suit fields, viz., survey Nos. 223, 225, and  226,\\t and\\nthat  too not the interest of 84 Dakdas in them\\nbut for\\t all\\nthe  100 Dakdas.  In fact, ever since the plaintiff came  on\\nthe  scene  the defendant has treated the plaintiff  as\\n the\\nlandlord  as regards these three survey numbers, and in\\t the\\npresent\\t suit, therefore, the defendant cannot\\tdispute\\t the\\nplaintiff\\'s\\nright to sue.\"\\n    In a later part of the judgment it was observed that  in\\nany case Ginwalla as the manager of the plaintiff firm\\nwould\\nbe  entitled to continue the present suit as  receiver.\\t  On\\nthe  second  question the learned judges of the\\t High  Court\\nobserved\\nas follows :-\\n    \"We do not think it necessary to decide whether if there\\nhad been a signed contract by the transferor in the  present\\ncase,  it would have fallen under section  53-A,because,  in\\nour  opinion, the correspondence Which is summarized in\\t the\\nGovernment\\nResolution cannot be regarded as evidence of\\t the\\ncontract,  and\\tsecondly,  the terms of\\t the  contract\\talso\\ncannot be deduced from\\nthe correspondence with any  reasona-\\nble  certainty.\\t  We, therefore, hold  that  the  Government\\nResolution  on which the defendant\\nrelies is no evidence  of\\nthe writing of a contract referred to in section 53-A of the\\nTransfer of Property Act, and apart from that\\nthe  defendant\\nhas  no legal basis on which he can claim to hold  the\\tland\\neither as a permanent lessee or for a particular period.\"\\n   The\\tprincipal  questions canvassed in this\\tappeal\\tare,\\nwhether the plaintiff firm has proved its title to  maintain\\nthe  present\\nsuit in ejectment against the  defendant,\\'\\t and\\nwhether\\t the  defendant is entitled to the  benefit  of\\t the\\nprovisions of sec. 53-A\\nof the Transfer of Property Act. The\\nquestion as to the maintainability of the suit\\'\\n83\\nagainst\\t the  defendant without a proper\\nnotice\\t was  raised\\nbefore the High Court but permission to argue it was refused\\nbecause\\t the  matter had not been raised in  either\\n of\\t the\\nlower Courts.<p>\\n    The\\t appeal\\t was  elaborately argued before\\t us  by\\t the\\nlearned\\t counsel for the parties, but in our view, it  is  \\'\\nnot  necessary\\nto consider and decide all the  points  urged\\nbecause\\t we consider that the Assistant Judge was  right  in\\nentertaining  and giving\\neffect to the plea under sec.\\t53-A\\nof  the Transfer of Property Act and we are satisfied\\tthat\\nno   substantial grounds existed  for\\nreversing- that  deci-\\nsion  in  second  appeal.  This section\\t introduced  in\\t the\\nTransfer of Property Act in 1929 is in these\\nterms :--\\n    \"Where  any person contracts to transfer for  considera-\\ntion  any immovable property by writing signed by him or \\non\\nhis behalf from which the terms necessary to constitute\\t the\\ntransfer can be ascertained with reasonable certainty,\\n    and\\t the\\n transferee  has, in  part-performance  of\\t the\\ncontract,  taken  possession  of the property  or  any\\tpart\\nthereof\\t ......\\t and\\nhas done some act in furtherance of the\\ncontract, and the transferee has performed or is willing  to\\nperform his part of the contract,\\n    then, notwithstanding that the contract, though required\\nto be registered, has not been registered  ...... the trans-\\nferor \\nor  any person claiming under him shall\\tbe  debarred\\nfrom  enforcing against the transferee and persons  claiming\\nunder him any right\\nin respect of the property of which\\t the\\ntransferee has taken or continued in possession, other\\tthan\\na   right   expressly\\tprovided\\n by  the   terms   of\\t the\\ncontract  ......  \".<p>\\n    The section\\t is  a partial\\t importation   in the  stat-\\nute law of  India  of the English  doctrine of part-perform-\\nance.  It\\nfurnishes a statutory defence to a person who\\t has\\nno. registered\\ttitle\\tdeed in his favour to maintain\\this-\\npossession if he can\\nprove a written and signed contract  in\\nhis  favour and some action on his part in  part-performance\\nof  that contract.  In \\'order\\nto find whether the  defendant\\nin the present case has satisfied the conditions of the\\n84\\nsection, it has to be held proved that\\nthe Talukdari Settle-\\nment  Officer contracted to give a lease of the survey\\tnum-\\nbers in suit to Manilal Maganlal by a writing signed\\nby\\t him\\nand  that from this writing the terms of the tenancy can  be\\nascertained with reasonable certainty.\\tIt has further to be\\nheld established that .the transferee took possession of the\\nproperty or did any acts in furtherance of the contract.  It\\nmay be\\nmentioned that in cases of lease the legislature\\t has\\nrecognized that the equity of part performance is an  active\\nequity\\tas  in\\nEnglish law and is sufficient to\\t support  an\\nindependent  action by the plaintiff. (Vide S. 27-A  of\\t the\\nSpecific  Relief Act).\\nThis section however applies to\\tcon-\\ntracts\\texecuted after 1st April, 1930, and has no  applica-\\ntion  in  the present case; but\\nthere can be no\\t mariner  of\\ndoubt  that the defence under Section\\t 53-A  is  available\\nto  a  person who has an agreement of lease\\n in\\t his  favour\\nthough\\tno lease has been executed and registered.   We\\t are\\nsatisfied  that the defendant has fulfilled both the\\n condi-\\ntions necessary to attract the application of the section in\\nthe  present case. The High Court was in error when it\\theld\\nthat  the correspondence summarised in Ex. 181 could not  be\\ntreated as evidence of the contract and that its terms could\\nnot  be\\n reasonably deduced from this document.\\t  It  is  no\\ndoubt true that Ex. 181 is merely secondary evidence of\\t the\\nagreement of lease\\nbut it is equally true that it is a\\tvery\\nreliable piece of secondary evidence coming as it does\\tfrom\\ngovernment  records.  It furnishes\\nproof of  the  fact\\tthat\\nthere was an acceptance in writing under which the  contract\\nto  transfer the survey numbers in suit by\\nway of lease\\t was\\neffected  by the Talukdari Settlement  Officer in favour  of\\nManilal\\t  Maganlal. The offer was also in writing\\nsigned  by\\nthe offeror. The Government Resolution which made the agree-\\nment binding was also in writing and was signed by competent\\nauthority.   No objection as to admission of secondary\\tevi-\\ndence  could be taken in this case as the  primary  evidence\\nwas  in\\n the possession either of the plaintiff\\t or  of\\t the\\ntalukdars,  the\\t predecessors in interest and  in  spite  of\\nnotice\\tit was not\\nproduced.  Reference in  this  connection\\nmay be made to the statement of the\\n85\\nplaintiff  in  the  witness box which is  to  the\\n following\\neffect :--\\n    \"I\\tmust have read the correspondence with T.S.O.  since\\nit is so recited in the para. 2 of the plaint.\\nI cannot\\t say\\nwhether\\t that  correspondence is in my office  or  with\\t the\\ntalukdars.   I cannot say without that correspondence\\nas  to\\nwhether T.S.O. has called survey No. 226\\nas  Lalliti and hence the talukdars are not entitled to\\t any\\nincome\\tfor it.\\t I also\\ncannot say without that\\t correspond-\\nence that the rents of survey Nos. 225 and 223 were fixed at\\nRs. 135 and Rs. 115 respectively\\nand that Rs. 45 were to  be\\ntaken by way of sugar...\"\\n    In\\tanother part of the same statement he said that\\t the\\ntalukdars  had\\ngot the records of the\\ttime  preceding\\t his\\nmanagement.   It  appears that the original  documents\\twere\\nreturned to the talukdars\\nafter the discharge of the  Taluk-\\ndari Settlement Officer and were in the possession and power\\nof  the plaintiff or his predecessors\\nin interest  and\\tthey\\nwere not produced by him in spite of notice.  Para. 2 of the\\nplaint clearly recites that there was correspondence\\nbetween\\nthe Talukdari Settlement Officer and the defendant\\'S  prede-\\ncessor in interest under which a lease was negotiated.\\t The\\nplaintiff\\'s  knowledge of this correspondence and  its\\tcon-\\ntents  is  thus\\n prima facie established and  leads  to\\t the\\nconclusion that it was in his possession or power and he has\\nintentionally withheld\\nit.  Without a perusal of this corre-\\nspondence  the\\tfacts  recited\\t in para. 2  of\\t the  plaint\\ncould  not  have  been\\t   mentioned\\n in  the plaint.\\tOnce\\nit   is\\t held  that  Ex. 181 is\\t good secondary evidence  of\\nthe  agreement of lease, there can then be no\\nhesitation  in\\nholding\\t that by an offer and an acceptance made in  writing\\nand  signed by the respective parties an agreement was\\ncom-\\npleted\\tbetween\\t the Talukdari Settlement  Officer  and\\t the\\npredecessor in interest of the defendant and that  necessary\\nsanction\\n of the\\' Government was also in writing  signed  by\\nthe  officer concerned.\\t It has further to be held that\\t the\\nterms of the contract\\ncan be fairly deduced from the  recit-\\nals of this document.  The only important clause with  which\\nwe are concerned in the present\\ncase is as to the nature  of\\nthe tenancy.  It is clearly recited therein\\n86\\nthat  the lease was to be of a permanent character  and\\n the\\nterms  as regards rental could be revised after a period  of\\nfifty  years.\\tThe rent payable is recited  in\\t unambiguous\\nterms\\nin the document as Rs. 290 per annum.<p>\\n    It was not denied that the lessee took possession  after\\nthis  agreement was arrived at.\\t It was argued that  posses-\\nsion  was\\n taken before sanction of the Government  was\\t ob-\\ntained\\tin  September, 1917.  There is however no  proof  of\\nthis  except  a\\t bare\\nrecital in  the  Talukdari  Settlement\\nOfficer\\'s  letter  to Government that he had  permitted\\t the\\ndefendant  to enter on the land\\nin anticipation\\t of  Govern-\\nment\\'s sanction.  As already pointed out, the possession was\\nwith the tenants and had to be taken after\\nentering into  an\\narrangement  with them or by issuing notice to them.  It  is\\nnot possible to think that this could have happened\\nin\\tsuch\\na short space of time as elapsed between the middle of\\tJuly\\nand  the  beginning of September.  In any case\\tthe  factory\\ncould\\nnot have been built before the sanction of the Govern-\\nment  was received. Not only did the lessee take  possession\\nin part-performance\\nof the agreement but he offered the rent\\nagreed upon and paid it not only to the Talukdari Settlement\\nOfficer but to all those who\\nsubsequently managed the inter-\\nest of the talukdars in the survey numbers in dispute.\\t The\\noriginal lessee after having entered\\ninto possession of\\t the\\nproperty effected a mortgage of it in favour of the  defend-\\nant.   The defendant advanced a substantial\\nsum on  security\\nof the property to the lessee.\\tThe equity of redemption was\\nsold at an auction sale.  The defendant and his\\t predecessor\\nin  interest were willing to perform their part of the\\tcon-\\ntract.\\t As a matter of fact, they have performed the  whole\\nof  it.\\t\\nAll that remains to be done is the execution  of  a\\nlease  deed  by the lessor in favour of the  lessee  and  of\\ngetting\\t it  registered.\\n The plaintiff in para.  6  of\\t the\\nplaint\\tin unambiguous terms admitted that he  received\\t the\\namount of the lease up to 31st July,\\n1932, in respect of the\\nsurvey numbers in dispute. It is difficult to imagine  what.<p>\\nlease  he  was referring to in the absence of  a  registered\\ndeed  of lease.\\t It Could only mean the agreement  of  lease\\ngiven in\\nwriting\\n87\\nand  signed  by the Talukdari Settlement Officer. It  is  in\\npursuance of this agreement of lease that all the subsequent\\nacts  above  mentioned were done.  It-may also\\tbe  observed\\nthat an agreement of lease creating a present demise but not\\nregistered\\nis admissible under S. 49 of the Indian Registra-\\ntion  Act  as evidence of part performance and\\tEx.  181  is\\nsecondary evidence\\nof that agreement. A formal lease is\\t not\\nnecessary  to  attract\\tthe application of S.  53-A  of\\t the\\nTransfer  of Property Act.\\nAll that is required is  that  an\\nagreement  in writing signed by the transferor can be  gath-\\nered from the evidence.\\t The correspondence\\nmentioned in Ex.<p>\\n181 fully establishes that fact.<p>\\n    We are therefore of the opinion that the learned Assist-\\nant  Judge  rightly dismissed the plaintiff\\'s suit  and\\t the\\nHigh Court\\nwas in error in interfering with that decision in\\nsecond\\tappeal.\\t The result therefore is that\\t the  appeal\\nis allowed, the decision\\nof the Assistant Judge restored and\\nthat  of  the High Court reversed.The circumstances  of\\t the\\ncase are such that we would make\\nno order as to costs.\\t The\\ndefendant was at fault\\tin not producing all the documentary\\nevidence  at  the proper stage of the case\\nand he  has\\tbeen\\nenabled\\t to  avail himself of the defence furnished  to\\t him\\nunder  S. 53-A by reason of the admission in evidence\\n after\\nremand\\tof  Ex. 181, which though not properly\\tadmitted  at\\nthat stage was not rejected by the High Court and could\\t not\\nbe\\n rejected at the stage when we dealt with the case.\\t The\\nparties are therefore left to bear their own costs  through-\\nout.<p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAppeal allowed.<p>\\nAgent for the appellant: S.P. Varma.<p>\\nAgent for the respondent: Ganpat Rai.<p>  <!--sino noindex-->\\n  <!--make_database footer start-->\\n  <p class=\"make-database\"></p>\\n  <hr class=\"make-database\">\\n  <small class=\"make-database\">\\n    <p class=\"make-database\">\\n    <b class=\"make-database\">\\nLIIofIndia:\\n    </b>\\n    <a href=\"/liiofindia/copyright.html\" class=\"make-database\">Copyright Policy</a>\\n    <b class=\"make-database\">|</b>\\n    <a href=\"/liiofindia/disclaimers.html\" class=\"make-database\">Disclaimers</a>\\n    <b class=\"make-database\">|</b>\\n    <a href=\"/liiofindia/privacy.html\" class=\"make-database\">Privacy Policy</a>\\n    <b class=\"make-database\">|</b>\\n    <a href=\"/liiofindia/feedback.html\" class=\"make-database\">Feedback</a><br>\\n    URL: <i class=\"make-database\">http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1950/6.html</i><br>\\n</p>\\n  </small>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n'"

It was in  this  confused\\nstate  of the record that it was eventually decided  by\\t the\\nHigh  Court  and its judgment is by no\\tmeans  satisfactory,\\nThe  long\\n time taken in deciding the  suit  which  involved\\ndetermination of a few simple issues is such as is calculat-\\ned to bring into\\nridicule the administration of justice.</p><p>\\n77\\n    There  is a talukdari estate called the Bhankoda  estate\\nin  Viramgam  taluka in Ahmedabad district.  It\\t is  jointly\\nowned\\nby several talukdars in different shares and comprises\\ntwelve\\tvillages one of which is Rampura in which  the\\tsuit\\nlands are situate.\\n By Government Resolution No. 8170, dated\\n30th   August  1912, the estate was taken  under  Government\\nmanagement  under  section\\n28 of the Gujarat  Talukdars\\t Act\\n(Bombay Act VI of 1888).  The firm of Shah Manilal  Maganlal\\nand  Bros. (predecessors in interest\\nof the  appellant)\\t de-\\nsired  to erect a ginning factory on survey Nos.  228,\\t225,\\nand  226 and with that object approached the\\nTalukdari\\tSet-\\ntlement\\t Officer for a permanent lease of these survey\\tnum-\\nbers.  The said officer agreed to grant a lease\\t subject\\n to\\nsanction  of  Government.  By Resolution No. 10795  of\\t1917\\ndated  5th September 1917 the Government of  Bombay  granted\\nthe\\n requisite sanction. Exhibit 181 is a certified copy  of\\nthe  letter  from the Chief Secretary to Government  to\\t the\\nCommissioner\\nand to the Talukdari Settlement Officer and  in\\ndetail\\tit  mentions the various steps taken to\\t effect\\t the\\ntransaction.</p><p>\\n    On\\t9th  December 1916 an application was made  by\\tShah\\nManilal\\t Maganlal in writing signed by him to the  Talukdari\\nSettlement\\nOfficer offering to take a permanent lease of the\\nabove  mentioned survey numbers on an annual rental  of\\t Rs.</p><p>\\n290 for the purpose of erecting a ginning factory.  On\\t12th\\nJuly 1917 the said officer accepted provisionally this offer\\nafter  taking\\n into consideration the objections  raised  by\\nsome  of the talukdars in respect of the grant of  a  lease.</p><p>\\nHe  submitted  the papers to government with  the  following\\nrecommendations :--\\n    \"As\\t the petitioner was in urgent need to  start\\n opera-\\ntions during the current ginning season I have in  anticipa-\\ntion of Government sanction permitted him to enter upon\\t the\\nland and have the honour to approach you for sanction  under\\nsection 27 (A) of the Court of Wards Act, the provisions  of\\nwhich \\nhave  been made applicable to  Talukdari\\t Estates  by\\nsection 29 (G) of the Gujarat Talukdars Act,\"\\n78\\n    The\\t conditions of the\\nlease agreed upon by the  parties\\nwere  annexed with this letter and a copy of the  offer\\t was\\nalso sent to Government. Ex. 181 recites\\nthe contents of the\\noffer and states the undertaking given by the lessee.  There\\nis intrinsic evidence within its contents to show\\nthat these\\nwritings were signed by the proposer. The Talukdari  Settle-\\nment Officer in a signed writing accepted the offer and sent\\nit  for\\t Government  sanction. It further  appears  that  he\\ncommunicated his acceptance to the lessee and agreed to give\\na lease\\nif Government gave sanction.  The survey numbers  in\\nquestion  were\\tin possession of tenants and it\\t was  agreed\\nthat  the lessee\\nwould take possession after making  private\\nsettlements  with them.\\t It was also agreed that if no\\tsuch\\nprivate\\t arrangement  could\\n be made,  then  the  settlement\\nofficer\\t would take steps to issue ejectment notice  against\\nthe tenants.  On 20th July, 1917, the\\nCommissioner forwarded\\nthe  papers to Government with his recommendations  and\\t the\\nGovernment  on 5th September, 1917, sanctioned\\nthe  arrange-\\nment agreed to by the Talukdari Settlement Officer with Shah\\nManilal Maganlal.  The sanction order is signed by the\\nChief\\nSecretary  to the Government and it contains an\\t endorsement\\nof  its having been sent to the officers concerned.   It  is\\nthus\\n clear  that a binding agreement to  lease\\t the  survey\\nnumbers\\t in  question  was effected  between  the  Talukdari\\nSettlement Officer\\nand Shah Manilal Maganlal with the  sanc-\\ntion  of the Government. Though a draft of a formal deed  of\\nlease  was prepared, no such\\ndocument was formally  executed\\nor registered for reasons which it is not necessary to state\\nherein.</p><p>\\n    Soon  after the agreement the lessee took possession  of\\nthe  survey numbers in suit and put up thereupon  a  ginning\\nand  a\\npressing factory, a bungalow, engine rooms and  other\\nstructures.   He tendered the agreed rent to  the  Talukdari\\nSettlement  Officer\\nwho received it from him.  He  continued\\nreceiving  it  for about two years when the estate  was\\t re-\\nleased from the management\\nof the Government and came  under\\nthe  management of the talukdars. The manager  appointed  by\\nthe  talukdars continued to receive\\nrent from the lessee  as\\nhad been settled by the Talukdari Settlement Officer.</p><p>\\n79\\n    On\\t4th May, 1924, a possessory mortgage of the  ginning\\nfactory\\t along with all its buildings was effected  by\\tShah\\nManilal\\nMaganlal in the sum of Rs. 1,40,000 in favour of the\\ndefendant.   The  mortgage included in the schedule  of\\t the\\nmortgaged  property\\nsome other property as \\'well.   The\\t two\\ncontestants  in the suit, the defendant and the\\t plaintiffs,\\nacquired  their\\t rights in\\nthis property  during  the  years\\n1924-25.   The\\tdefend ant came in as a mortgagee  as  above\\nstated, while the plaintiffs came in\\nas ijaradar and assign-\\nee  of certain mortgage rights.\\t The plaintiffs\\t since\\tthen\\nhave been receiving the rent according to the\\ngrant made  by\\nthe  Talukdari\\tOfficer.   In the year\\t1933  the  appellant\\npurchased the equity of redemption of the suit property\\nat a\\ncourt auction and became vested with all the rights of Mani-\\nlal  Maganlal in this property, the value of which  has\\t now\\nbeen\\nestimated in the neighbourhood of Rs. 38,000.</p><p>\\n    In\\tthe  year 1933\\tthe plaintiffs discovered  that\\t the\\ndefendant   had\\t no  registered\\t lease\\tin  his\\t favour\\t and\\ntherefore\\n in  law he  was not entitled to the rights  of  a\\npermanent  tenant  in respect of the   survey\\tnumbers\\t  in\\ndispute.  They\\ttherefore\\ninstituted the present  suit\\t for\\nejectment  of the defendant.  In the 2nd and 3rd  paragraphs\\nof  the plaint it was  admitted that\\nin .the course  of\\t the\\ncorrespondence\\twith  the Government of Bombay a  lease\\t was\\nnegotiated   between the firm of Shah Manilal\\n Maganlal\\t and\\nthe  Talukari  Settlement Officer in respect of\\t the  survey\\nnumbers in dispute for a period of fifty years at an\\n annual\\nrental\\tof Rs. 290, but it was stated that  because  Manilal\\nMaganlal did not execute a formal registered lease they were\\nin  possession\\tas  trespassers. In the\\t 4th  paragraph\\t the\\nauthority  of the Talukdari Settlement Officer to grant\\t the\\nlease was\\nalso challenged.  In the 8th paragraph it was said\\nthat  the plaintiffs received the amount of the lease up  to\\n31st July 1932 and\\nthat no notice was necessary to be given,\\nthe position of the defendant being that of a trespasser. It\\nwas however alleged that a\\nnotice was given on 25th December\\n1930,\\n11\\n80\\n    The suit was defended on a number of grounds,inter alia,\\nit  was pleaded that the\\nplaintiffs had no right to  sue  in\\nejectment,  not being the landlord inasmuch as they had\\t not\\nobtained  any right in the land\\nitself and had not  acquired\\ncomplete title by an assignment of the whole of the interest\\nof  the talukdars in the survey numbers\\nin dispute.  It\\t was\\npleaded\\t that  the defendant was a permanent tenant  of\\t the\\nsurvey numbers and that the plaintiffs\\' own conduct\\ndebarred\\nthem from claiming ejectment.</p><p>\\n   The\\ttrial Judge decreed the suit on the finding that  as\\nno  written lease was forthcoming it should be deemed to  be\\nnon-existent.\\n It was said that no efforts had been made  to\\nshow  that  the Settlement Officer had sanctioned  with\\t the\\napproval  of the Government\\na permanent lease in respect  of\\nsurvey\\tNos. 223 and 225 to Shah Manilal Maganlal.   In\\t the\\nconcluding  part  of the judgment it\\nwas remarked  that\\t the\\ndoctrine  of equitable part performance could not  apply  to\\nthe  present  case. Though no specific issue\\nwas  raised  on\\nthis  point,  the matter seems to have been argued  at\\tsome\\nstage  before  the trial Judge on facts found  or  admitted.</p><p>\\nThere was an unsuccessful effort to obtain a review of this\\ndecision  on  the  ground  of  discovery  of  fresh  materi-\\nals.  Thereafter\\nthe matter was taken to the court of appeal\\nand  it\\t was alleged in ground No. 3  that  the\\t Subordinate\\nJudge  had erred in not\\nconsidering the position created  in\\nthe  case by the equitable rule of law embodied\\t in  section\\n53-A  of the Transfer of Property\\nAct.\\tOn 30th July,  1938,\\nthe appellate court made an order of remand under Order XLI,\\nRule  25,  and\\tcalled for a report  on\\t the\\n following\\t two\\nissues:-\\n   (1) Whether the plaintiff was a mortgagee in occupa-\\ntion of S. Nos. 222, 223, 225 and 226 ?\\n   (2) Whether\\nthe suit was bad for non-joinder of\\nparties ?\\n    The\\t trial Judge reported on the remand  issues  against\\nthe  plaintiffs.  He also\\nadmitted in evidence a  number  of\\ndocuments produced after remand and one of these is Ex. 181.</p><p>\\nA point was raised that documents produced after remand Were\\nnot relevant to the issues remanded\\n81\\nand should not be admitted. \\nThis contention was  overruled.</p><p>\\nThe Assistant Judge allowed the appeal on 27th April,  1940.</p><p>\\nHe  held that the plaintiffs had failed to  establish  their\\nright to maintain the suit either as ijaradars or as assign-\\nees  of\\nmortgage  rights.   In para. 21 of his\\tjudgment  he\\nobserved as follows :--\\n    \"Ex.  181  shows that the terms of the lease  have\\nbeen\\nreduced to writing though  no regular  lease appears to have\\nbeen executed.\\tOn the question whether the lease is binding\\non\\n the plaintiff, I think section 53-A of the\\tTransfer  of\\nthe  Property Act is a complete answer.\\t Ex. 181 shows\\tthat\\nthe  Talukdari\\nSettlement Officer, with the sanction of\\t the\\nGovernment, contracted to lease out these lands.  The  writ-\\ning is signed by the Government.\\n The terms of the lease can\\nbe ascertained clearly from Ex. 181.  It is not denied\\tthat\\nthe  defendant\\'s predecessor-in-title was\\nput in  possession\\nof this property in performance of that contract.  Also\\t the\\nacceptance by the Talukdari Settlement Officer as\\n  well  as\\nby  the plaintiff of the rent of the property as   fixed  by\\nthat  contract shows that. the possession of  the  defendant\\nand his predecessor-in-title was in part performance of\\t the\\ncontract  of   lease.  Admittedly, there  is  no  registered\\nlease.\\n The conditions of section 53-A of the\\tTransfer  of\\nProperty  Act are fully satisfied and the plaintiff  cannot,\\ntherefore,  eject\\nthe defendant on the ground that there  is\\nno registered lease.\"\\n    Further  on the learned Judge said that section 53-A  of\\nthe\\n \\'Transfer\\tof  Property Act embodied  the\\tdoctrine  of\\nestoppel  and a plea to that effect had been taken  inasmuch\\nas  the\\t defendant\\n had pleaded\\t that  the  plaintiffs\\twere\\nestopped  by  their conduct from asking for  possession\\t and\\nthat therefore no separate\\nissue was raised on this point.</p><p>\\n    The\\t unsuccessful  plaintiffs went up in  second  appeal\\nagainst this decision to the High. Court of Bombay. The High\\nCourt \\nallowed\\tthe appeal and modified the  decree  of\\t the\\nAssistant Judge.  It decreed the plaintiffs\\' suit in respect\\nof survey Nos.\\n223 and 225 and dismissed the suit in respect\\nof survey Nos. 222 and 226,\\n82\\nOn  the\\t question of the plaintiffs\\' title to  maintain\\n the\\nsuit the High Court reached the following decision:-\\n    \"If\\t it were necessary we would hold that the  plaintiff\\nhas sufficiently\\nproved that it is entitled to maintain this\\nsuit  in its capacity as ijaradar as well as  assignee\\tfrom\\nthe mortgagees. But we think\\neven apart from that, plaintiff\\nis  entitled to bring this suit because on  the\\t defendant\\'s\\nown admission he has paid rent to the\\nplaintiff for three of\\nthe  suit fields, viz., survey Nos. 223, 225, and  226,\\t and\\nthat  too not the interest of 84 Dakdas in them\\nbut for\\t all\\nthe  100 Dakdas.  In fact, ever since the plaintiff came  on\\nthe  scene  the defendant has treated the plaintiff  as\\n the\\nlandlord  as regards these three survey numbers, and in\\t the\\npresent\\t suit, therefore, the defendant cannot\\tdispute\\t the\\nplaintiff\\'s\\nright to sue.\"\\n    In a later part of the judgment it was observed that  in\\nany case Ginwalla as the manager of the plaintiff firm\\nwould\\nbe  entitled to continue the present suit as  receiver.\\t  On\\nthe  second  question the learned judges of the\\t High  Court\\nobserved\\nas follows :-\\n    \"We do not think it necessary to decide whether if there\\nhad been a signed contract by the transferor in the  present\\ncase,  it would have fallen under section  53-A,because,  in\\nour  opinion, the correspondence Which is summarized in\\t the\\nGovernment\\nResolution cannot be regarded as evidence of\\t the\\ncontract,  and\\tsecondly,  the terms of\\t the  contract\\talso\\ncannot be deduced from\\nthe correspondence with any  reasona-\\nble  certainty.\\t  We, therefore, hold  that  the  Government\\nResolution  on which the defendant\\nrelies is no evidence  of\\nthe writing of a contract referred to in section 53-A of the\\nTransfer of Property Act, and apart from that\\nthe  defendant\\nhas  no legal basis on which he can claim to hold  the\\tland\\neither as a permanent lessee or for a particular period.\"\\n   The\\tprincipal  questions canvassed in this\\tappeal\\tare,\\nwhether the plaintiff firm has proved its title to  maintain\\nthe  present\\nsuit in ejectment against the  defendant,\\'\\t and\\nwhether\\t the  defendant is entitled to the  benefit  of\\t the\\nprovisions of sec. 53-A\\nof the Transfer of Property Act. The\\nquestion as to the maintainability of the suit\\'\\n83\\nagainst\\t the  defendant without a proper\\nnotice\\t was  raised\\nbefore the High Court but permission to argue it was refused\\nbecause\\t the  matter had not been raised in  either\\n of\\t the\\nlower Courts.</p><p>\\n    The\\t appeal\\t was  elaborately argued before\\t us  by\\t the\\nlearned\\t counsel for the parties, but in our view, it  is  \\'\\nnot  necessary\\nto consider and decide all the  points  urged\\nbecause\\t we consider that the Assistant Judge was  right  in\\nentertaining  and giving\\neffect to the plea under sec.\\t53-A\\nof  the Transfer of Property Act and we are satisfied\\tthat\\nno   substantial grounds existed  for\\nreversing- that  deci-\\nsion  in  second  appeal.  This section\\t introduced  in\\t the\\nTransfer of Property Act in 1929 is in these\\nterms :--\\n    \"Where  any person contracts to transfer for  considera-\\ntion  any immovable property by writing signed by him or \\non\\nhis behalf from which the terms necessary to constitute\\t the\\ntransfer can be ascertained with reasonable certainty,\\n    and\\t the\\n transferee  has, in  part-performance  of\\t the\\ncontract,  taken  possession  of the property  or  any\\tpart\\nthereof\\t ......\\t and\\nhas done some act in furtherance of the\\ncontract, and the transferee has performed or is willing  to\\nperform his part of the contract,\\n    then, notwithstanding that the contract, though required\\nto be registered, has not been registered  ...... the trans-\\nferor \\nor  any person claiming under him shall\\tbe  debarred\\nfrom  enforcing against the transferee and persons  claiming\\nunder him any right\\nin respect of the property of which\\t the\\ntransferee has taken or continued in possession, other\\tthan\\na   right   expressly\\tprovided\\n by  the   terms   of\\t the\\ncontract  ......  \".</p><p>\\n    The section\\t is  a partial\\t importation   in the  stat-\\nute law of  India  of the English  doctrine of part-perform-\\nance.  It\\nfurnishes a statutory defence to a person who\\t has\\nno. registered\\ttitle\\tdeed in his favour to maintain\\this-\\npossession if he can\\nprove a written and signed contract  in\\nhis  favour and some action on his part in  part-performance\\nof  that contract.  In \\'order\\nto find whether the  defendant\\nin the present case has satisfied the conditions of the\\n84\\nsection, it has to be held proved that\\nthe Talukdari Settle-\\nment  Officer contracted to give a lease of the survey\\tnum-\\nbers in suit to Manilal Maganlal by a writing signed\\nby\\t him\\nand  that from this writing the terms of the tenancy can  be\\nascertained with reasonable certainty.\\tIt has further to be\\nheld established that .the transferee took possession of the\\nproperty or did any acts in furtherance of the contract.  It\\nmay be\\nmentioned that in cases of lease the legislature\\t has\\nrecognized that the equity of part performance is an  active\\nequity\\tas  in\\nEnglish law and is sufficient to\\t support  an\\nindependent  action by the plaintiff. (Vide S. 27-A  of\\t the\\nSpecific  Relief Act).\\nThis section however applies to\\tcon-\\ntracts\\texecuted after 1st April, 1930, and has no  applica-\\ntion  in  the present case; but\\nthere can be no\\t mariner  of\\ndoubt  that the defence under Section\\t 53-A  is  available\\nto  a  person who has an agreement of lease\\n in\\t his  favour\\nthough\\tno lease has been executed and registered.   We\\t are\\nsatisfied  that the defendant has fulfilled both the\\n condi-\\ntions necessary to attract the application of the section in\\nthe  present case. The High Court was in error when it\\theld\\nthat  the correspondence summarised in Ex. 181 could not  be\\ntreated as evidence of the contract and that its terms could\\nnot  be\\n reasonably deduced from this document.\\t  It  is  no\\ndoubt true that Ex. 181 is merely secondary evidence of\\t the\\nagreement of lease\\nbut it is equally true that it is a\\tvery\\nreliable piece of secondary evidence coming as it does\\tfrom\\ngovernment  records.  It furnishes\\nproof of  the  fact\\tthat\\nthere was an acceptance in writing under which the  contract\\nto  transfer the survey numbers in suit by\\nway of lease\\t was\\neffected  by the Talukdari Settlement  Officer in favour  of\\nManilal\\t  Maganlal. The offer was also in writing\\nsigned  by\\nthe offeror. The Government Resolution which made the agree-\\nment binding was also in writing and was signed by competent\\nauthority.   No objection as to admission of secondary\\tevi-\\ndence  could be taken in this case as the  primary  evidence\\nwas  in\\n the possession either of the plaintiff\\t or  of\\t the\\ntalukdars,  the\\t predecessors in interest and  in  spite  of\\nnotice\\tit was not\\nproduced.  Reference in  this  connection\\nmay be made to the statement of the\\n85\\nplaintiff  in  the  witness box which is  to  the\\n following\\neffect :--\\n    \"I\\tmust have read the correspondence with T.S.O.  since\\nit is so recited in the para. 2 of the plaint.\\nI cannot\\t say\\nwhether\\t that  correspondence is in my office  or  with\\t the\\ntalukdars.   I cannot say without that correspondence\\nas  to\\nwhether T.S.O. has called survey No. 226\\nas  Lalliti and hence the talukdars are not entitled to\\t any\\nincome\\tfor it.\\t I also\\ncannot say without that\\t correspond-\\nence that the rents of survey Nos. 225 and 223 were fixed at\\nRs. 135 and Rs. 115 respectively\\nand that Rs. 45 were to  be\\ntaken by way of sugar...\"\\n    In\\tanother part of the same statement he said that\\t the\\ntalukdars  had\\ngot the records of the\\ttime  preceding\\t his\\nmanagement.   It  appears that the original  documents\\twere\\nreturned to the talukdars\\nafter the discharge of the  Taluk-\\ndari Settlement Officer and were in the possession and power\\nof  the plaintiff or his predecessors\\nin interest  and\\tthey\\nwere not produced by him in spite of notice.  Para. 2 of the\\nplaint clearly recites that there was correspondence\\nbetween\\nthe Talukdari Settlement Officer and the defendant\\'S  prede-\\ncessor in interest under which a lease was negotiated.\\t The\\nplaintiff\\'s  knowledge of this correspondence and  its\\tcon-\\ntents  is  thus\\n prima facie established and  leads  to\\t the\\nconclusion that it was in his possession or power and he has\\nintentionally withheld\\nit.  Without a perusal of this corre-\\nspondence  the\\tfacts  recited\\t in para. 2  of\\t the  plaint\\ncould  not  have  been\\t   mentioned\\n in  the plaint.\\tOnce\\nit   is\\t held  that  Ex. 181 is\\t good secondary evidence  of\\nthe  agreement of lease, there can then be no\\nhesitation  in\\nholding\\t that by an offer and an acceptance made in  writing\\nand  signed by the respective parties an agreement was\\ncom-\\npleted\\tbetween\\t the Talukdari Settlement  Officer  and\\t the\\npredecessor in interest of the defendant and that  necessary\\nsanction\\n of the\\' Government was also in writing  signed  by\\nthe  officer concerned.\\t It has further to be held that\\t the\\nterms of the contract\\ncan be fairly deduced from the  recit-\\nals of this document.  The only important clause with  which\\nwe are concerned in the present\\ncase is as to the nature  of\\nthe tenancy.  It is clearly recited therein\\n86\\nthat  the lease was to be of a permanent character  and\\n the\\nterms  as regards rental could be revised after a period  of\\nfifty  years.\\tThe rent payable is recited  in\\t unambiguous\\nterms\\nin the document as Rs. 290 per annum.</p><p>\\n    It was not denied that the lessee took possession  after\\nthis  agreement was arrived at.\\t It was argued that  posses-\\nsion  was\\n taken before sanction of the Government  was\\t ob-\\ntained\\tin  September, 1917.  There is however no  proof  of\\nthis  except  a\\t bare\\nrecital in  the  Talukdari  Settlement\\nOfficer\\'s  letter  to Government that he had  permitted\\t the\\ndefendant  to enter on the land\\nin anticipation\\t of  Govern-\\nment\\'s sanction.  As already pointed out, the possession was\\nwith the tenants and had to be taken after\\nentering into  an\\narrangement  with them or by issuing notice to them.  It  is\\nnot possible to think that this could have happened\\nin\\tsuch\\na short space of time as elapsed between the middle of\\tJuly\\nand  the  beginning of September.  In any case\\tthe  factory\\ncould\\nnot have been built before the sanction of the Govern-\\nment  was received. Not only did the lessee take  possession\\nin part-performance\\nof the agreement but he offered the rent\\nagreed upon and paid it not only to the Talukdari Settlement\\nOfficer but to all those who\\nsubsequently managed the inter-\\nest of the talukdars in the survey numbers in dispute.\\t The\\noriginal lessee after having entered\\ninto possession of\\t the\\nproperty effected a mortgage of it in favour of the  defend-\\nant.   The defendant advanced a substantial\\nsum on  security\\nof the property to the lessee.\\tThe equity of redemption was\\nsold at an auction sale.  The defendant and his\\t predecessor\\nin  interest were willing to perform their part of the\\tcon-\\ntract.\\t As a matter of fact, they have performed the  whole\\nof  it.\\t\\nAll that remains to be done is the execution  of  a\\nlease  deed  by the lessor in favour of the  lessee  and  of\\ngetting\\t it  registered.\\n The plaintiff in para.  6  of\\t the\\nplaint\\tin unambiguous terms admitted that he  received\\t the\\namount of the lease up to 31st July,\\n1932, in respect of the\\nsurvey numbers in dispute. It is difficult to imagine  what.</p><p>\\nlease  he  was referring to in the absence of  a  registered\\ndeed  of lease.\\t It Could only mean the agreement  of  lease\\ngiven in\\nwriting\\n87\\nand  signed  by the Talukdari Settlement Officer. It  is  in\\npursuance of this agreement of lease that all the subsequent\\nacts  above  mentioned were done.  It-may also\\tbe  observed\\nthat an agreement of lease creating a present demise but not\\nregistered\\nis admissible under S. 49 of the Indian Registra-\\ntion  Act  as evidence of part performance and\\tEx.  181  is\\nsecondary evidence\\nof that agreement. A formal lease is\\t not\\nnecessary  to  attract\\tthe application of S.  53-A  of\\t the\\nTransfer  of Property Act.\\nAll that is required is  that  an\\nagreement  in writing signed by the transferor can be  gath-\\nered from the evidence.\\t The correspondence\\nmentioned in Ex.</p><p>\\n181 fully establishes that fact.</p><p>\\n    We are therefore of the opinion that the learned Assist-\\nant  Judge  rightly dismissed the plaintiff\\'s suit  and\\t the\\nHigh Court\\nwas in error in interfering with that decision in\\nsecond\\tappeal.\\t The result therefore is that\\t the  appeal\\nis allowed, the decision\\nof the Assistant Judge restored and\\nthat  of  the High Court reversed.The circumstances  of\\t the\\ncase are such that we would make\\nno order as to costs.\\t The\\ndefendant was at fault\\tin not producing all the documentary\\nevidence  at  the proper stage of the case\\nand he  has\\tbeen\\nenabled\\t to  avail himself of the defence furnished  to\\t him\\nunder  S. 53-A by reason of the admission in evidence\\n after\\nremand\\tof  Ex. 181, which though not properly\\tadmitted  at\\nthat stage was not rejected by the High Court and could\\t not\\nbe\\n rejected at the stage when we dealt with the case.\\t The\\nparties are therefore left to bear their own costs  through-\\nout.</p><p>\\n\\t\\t\\tAppeal allowed.</p><p>\\nAgent for the appellant: S.P.
